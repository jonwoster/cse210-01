Overview
Tic-Tac-Toe is a game in which two players seek in alternate turns to complete a row, a column, or a diagonal with either three x's or three o's drawn in the spaces of a grid of nine squares.

Rules
Tic-Tac-Toe is played according to the following rules.

The game is played on a grid that is three squares by three squares.
Player one uses x's. Player two uses o's.
Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
